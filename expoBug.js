This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and involves a mismatch between the version of Expo Go installed on your device and the project's SDK version.  The Expo CLI might try to use a newer version of Expo Go than the one you have installed, leading to an incompatibility. This usually manifests as a cryptic error message during the development process or when trying to run the app on your device.  Example:
```
Error: Something went wrong while building or installing the app.
```
The message is often unhelpful and doesn't explicitly point to a version mismatch.
