The solution involves ensuring version compatibility between your Expo Go app and your project's SDK version.  Update both to the latest compatible versions.  You'll need to check the Expo documentation for the latest compatible versions of Expo Go and SDKs. Here's how you can generally handle it:

1. **Update Expo Go:** Uninstall the existing Expo Go app from your device and reinstall it from the app store.
2. **Update app.json:** Check the `sdkVersion` in your `app.json` file, which determines the SDK version for your project. Update it to the latest compatible version (refer to Expo's documentation for the latest versions).  Example:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "sdkVersion": "48.0.0" // Update this to the latest compatible version
  }
}
```
3. **Clear caches:** Run these commands in your terminal:
```bash
expo start --clear
npm start -- --reset-cache
```
4. **Update expo-cli (if necessary):**
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```
5. **Reinstall dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```
6.  Re-run the app. If problems persist, completely remove the `node_modules` folder and re-install dependencies:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```
